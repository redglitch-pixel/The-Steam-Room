Cricket Ireland bring in a series of pay cuts

<p>Cricket Ireland have implemented a series of cost-cutting measures in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis that has put a handbrake on its international and domestic schedule.  </p>
<p>Ireland's men's tour to Zimbabwe has already been cancelled while home games against New Zealand and Pakistan, due to take place in June and July, are unlikely to go ahead.  </p>
<p>The senior women's trip to Thailand has already been postponed due to the current crisis.  </p>
<p>Starting this month, all non-playing staff will see a 20% reduction in their salaries for April and May, while CEO Warren Deutrom will take an additional 5% cut, which will apply to the end of 2020, with some staff also asked to take some mandatory leave between now and the end of May.</p>
<p>In addition, employees based in the North will be furloughed until the end of May, in line with the UK Government's job retention scheme.</p>
<p>Regarding contracted players, the Board recognised that the players were already losing out significantly through loss of match fees from a number of already-postponed, and possibly to-be-postponed series, and so will not take a further cut to their "base remuneration".</p>
<p>Deutrom has admitted that Ireland's men's home series against New Zealand and Pakistan this summer "may be postponed if Government restrictions remain in place".</p>
<p>Speaking further on the cost-cutting measures, the CEO said: "We're all going to have to take a pragmatic approach - we just don't know what's going to happen even if sport does get back up and running in June.</p>
<p><i><q>Attaining visas for visiting teams and their support staff may not be possible as the Department of Foreign Affairs and the UK Foreign Office are currently not processing visa applications.
<br>
<br>
In addition, each country will take the advice of their home government, so teams may not even be in a position to travel to Europe.
<br>
<br>
For our senior women’s team, we have already had to postpone a tour to Thailand, and we are maintaining contact with ICC in relation to the 50-over World Cup qualifier scheduled for July. </q></i></p>
<p>On the domestic front, Cricket Ireland will continue all regular payments to its provincial unions.</p>
<p><i><q>Irish cricket fans should rest assured we shall do all we can to hold viable competitions this year,</q></i> Deutrom added.</p>
<p><i><qOne scenario we are looking at is to play as many Inter-Provincial matches as possible on weekdays only.</q></i></p>
<p>The Cricket Ireland Board also agreed to the postponement of its AGM – which was due to be held in late April - until a date that could ensure physical attendance by members.</p>
