			<p>Manchester United legend Gary Neville once made a century batting alongside Matthew Hayden and yet, he’s not even the best cricketer in the family. </p>
			<p>Andrew Flintoff believes that his brother, Phil, could have been England’s answer to batting greats Ricky Ponting or Sachin Tendulkar had he not chosen a football career instead.</p>
			<p>The former United and Everton defender played alongside Flintoff in Lancashire before the pair followed separate, yet equally successful paths.</p>
			<p>Flintoff eventually became one of England’s greatest ever all-rounders and won the 2005 Ashes, while Phil won six Premier League titles with United alongside brother Gary.</p>
			<p>In 1992, a 17-year-old Gary scored an unbeaten 110 alongside Australia cricketing great Hayden in Bolton’s Hamer Cup.</p>
			<p>But speaking to talkSPORT, Flintoff insisted it was Phil who was the more talented cricketer.</p>
			<p><i><q>He [Phil] was a year older than me and he was a cricketing genius,</q></i> Flintoff said.</p>
			<p><i><q>This is a big call, but if he had carried on playing cricket he could have been England’s Ricky Ponting or Sachin Tendulkar. He was that good.
			<br>
			<br>
			He used to turn up, open the batting and score a hundred every time he batted, and then he’d bowl everyone out.
			<br>
			<br>
			He was a quick bowler and he got offered a contract at Lancashire - I think £2,500 was the wage - or go play at United.
			<br>
			<br>
			Luckily he went to United otherwise I might have ended up at Derbyshire or something.</q></i></p>
