			<p>Mikel Arteta has claimed he has now recovered from coronavirus after speaking about contracting the illness for the first time.</p>
			<p>Around 100 staff at the club – including the first-team squad – have been self-isolating since the Gunners head coach tested positive, confirmation of which triggered a chain of events which eventually led to the suspension of Premier League matches.</p>
			<p>Arsenal were due to resume training at London Colney on March 24 but after an escalation in government measures to tackle to the spread of Covid-19 and an extension of the domestic football hiatus from April 3 to April 30, those plans have now been cancelled.</p>
			<p>Arteta, however, believes he is now back to full health after discussing the last two-and-half weeks with Spanish television station La Sexta, a period which began with Arsenal’s Europa League last-32 exit to Olympiacos at Emirates Stadium.</p>
			<p><i><q>I’m very well now, I feel that I have recovered,</q></i>said the 37-year-old.<i><q>It took me three or four days to start feeling much better and with more energy, to leave the symptoms behind and now, the truth is that I feel very well.</q></i></p>
			<p>After playing Olympiacos on April 5, Arsenal travelled to Portsmouth for an FA Cup tie. Four Pompey players have tested positive since the Gunners’ 2-0 win with the League One club waiting for the outcome of further tests.</p>
			<p><i><q>Everything happened very fast,</q></i> said Arteta. <i><q>On [the] Tuesday afternoon I was feeling so-so and I went to see the doctor but he wasn’t there.
			<br>
			<br>
			I got a call from the board of directors after training while I was in my car and they told me that the president of Olympiacos [Evangelos Marinakis] had tested positive and everyone that had been in contact was at risk.
			<br>
			<br>
			I went on to tell them that I wasn’t feeling well and that we had a situation because we had lots of players that had been in contact with them [Olympiacos]. We had a game against Manchester City the next day and obviously we couldn’t put lots of people at risk without saying anything.
			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			I had the test done last Wednesday and I was diagnosed on Friday, when we had to communicate it to the Premier League that I had tested positive.
			<br>
			<br>
			Obviously all those that had been in contact with me had to go into quarantine, and consequently, games had to be suspended.</q></i></p>
